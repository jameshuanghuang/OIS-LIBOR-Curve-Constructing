# OIS-LIBOR-Curve-Constructing
 This is a redo hw from Baruch College Interes Rate model course.
 Using B-spline to construct OIS/LIBOR curve
 Price Interest Rate Swap and Basis Swap Rate
 Implementation of B-spline uses Tikhonov regularization as penality in objective function to estimate optimal coefficients (f_{k},l_{k})
 used BFGS with 50 iterations for finding coefficients.
